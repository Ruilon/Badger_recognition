In the above videos, you could see frames like the following. 
<br /> Subplot a shows a input frame in a video.
<br /> Subplot b shows the average variation of the activated pixels in the current frame. A threshold is set to 20. A frame whose average variation above 20 is sent for classification. 
<br />  Subplot c  illustrate the cleared version of the activated pixels, with optical flow indicating of the motion estimations. <br />  Subplot d  prints the classification result of the interest frame.
