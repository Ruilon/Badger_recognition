<br /> Subplot a: a input frame in a video.
<br /> Subplot b: the average variation of the activated pixels in the current frame. A threshold is set to 20. A frame whose average variation above 20 is sent for classification. 
<br />  Subplot c: the cleared version of the activated pixels, with optical flow indicating of the motion estimations. 
<br />  Subplot d: if a frame is activated, it will be classified by the trained CNN framework, the classification result will be printed on the top right corner.
